h1. !http://railsapps.github.io/images/rails-36x36.jpg(RailsApps Testing Gem)! RailsApps Testing Gem

See a blog post about "Why I wrote this gem":http://blog.railsapps.org/post/84339605200/railsapps-testing-gem. I primarily use RSpec and Capybara for testing, but in principle, the gem could also set up Test::Unit or Cucumber frameworks. Also, you may want other configurations for RSpec, so let me know and we can extend the gem.

If you're new to testing, I've written a tutorial on Rails testing with RSPec:

* "RSpec Tutorial":http://railsapps.github.io/rspec.html

h2. About

Use this gem to set up a testing framework. The gem modifies a Rails application and configures:

* "RSpec Rails":https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails – installs RSpec gems with support for Rails
* "Capybara":https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara – tests web pages
* "Database Cleaner":https://github.com/bmabey/database_cleaner – a clean slate for databases
* "FactoryBot Rails":https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot – creates test data
* "Launchy":https://github.com/copiousfreetime/launchy – view errors in your web browser
* "Selenium Webdriver":http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/ – for tests that require JavaScript

This suite of gems is popular for testing Rails applications. Typically, a developer makes several small configuration changes when setting up a test framework with these gems. The configuration changes are easy to make manually, but this gem provides a generator to make the changes, for ease of use with an automated process such as an application template.

The gem also offers options to install test suites for Devise or OmniAuth.

RailsApps Testing is a utility gem to use during development. You can remove it after setting up your test framework. It was originally written for use by the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool. Use Rails Composer to build any of the "RailApps example applications":http://railsapps.github.io/ for use as starter apps.

If you like the RailsApps Testing gem, you might be interested in the "RailsLayout gem":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout which generates Rails application layout files for various front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation.

h4. Support the RailsApps Project

If the RailsApps Testing gem is useful to you, please accept our invitation to "join the RailsApps project":http://railsapps.github.io/. The RailsApps project provides example applications, tutorials, and starter tools, including the RailsApps Testing gem.

h2. Install a Testing Framework

The RailsApps project offers a tutorial on Rails testing with RSPec:

* "RSpec Tutorial":http://railsapps.github.io/rspec.html

To install a testing framework, add the gems you need. Then use the RailsApps Testing gem. It will set up and configure your testing framework.

Add the gems you need to your Rails application Gemfile:

<pre>
group :development do
  gem 'rails_apps_testing'
end
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
  gem 'factory_bot'
end
group :test do
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'database_cleaner'
  gem 'launchy'
  gem 'selenium-webdriver'
end
</pre>

You don't need the RailsApps Testing gem deployed to production, so put it in the @development@ group.

If you want to use a newer unreleased version from GitHub:

<pre>
group :development do
  gem 'rails_apps_testing', github: 'RailsApps/rails_apps_testing'
end
</pre>

h4. Use Bundler

Use Bundler to install the gems:

<pre>
$ bundle install
</pre>

h2. Configure RSpec and Friends

To run the generator and configure the testing framework:

<pre>
$ rails generate testing:configure rspec
</pre>

Use @--force@ if you want to overwrite existing files:

<pre>
$ rails generate testing:configure rspec --force
</pre>

h3. RSpec Configuration

The RailsApps Testing generator will remove the legacy *test/* folder if it exists (it is not needed for RSpec).

The RailsApps Testing generator will run @rails generate rspec:install@ to create three files and a folder:

* *.rspec*
* *spec/*
* *spec/spec_helper.rb*
* *spec/rails_helper.rb*

Then the RailsApps Testing generator will configure RSpec.

It will modify the file *.rspec* to add:

<pre>
--format documentation
--require rails_helper
</pre>

and will remove:

<pre>
--warnings
</pre>

Prior to RSpec 3.0, every RSpec test file had to include @require 'spec_helper'@. With RSpec 3.0 and later versions, an additional @require 'rails_helper'@ became necessary. Fortunately, starting with RSpec 3.0, to eliminate clutter and duplication, these requirements can be specified in the project setting *.rspec* file.

It will modify the file *config/application.rb* to suppress creation of stub files that many developers don't use:

<pre>
config.generators do |g|
  g.test_framework :rspec,
    fixtures: true,
    view_specs: false,
    helper_specs: false,
    routing_specs: false,
    controller_specs: false,
    request_specs: false
  g.fixture_replacement :factory_bot, dir: "spec/factories"
end
</pre>

h3. Capybara and Launchy Configuration

The generator will set up Capybara and Launchy to display CSS and JavaScript with a file *spec/support/capybara.rb*:

<pre>
Capybara.asset_host = 'http://localhost:3000'
</pre>

h3. Database Cleaner Configuration

The generator will set up Database Cleaner to test JavaScript with a file *spec/support/database_cleaner.rb*:

<pre>
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before(:suite) do
    DatabaseCleaner.clean_with(:truncation)
  end

  config.before(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
  end

  config.before(:each, :js => true) do
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
  end

  config.before(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.start
  end

  config.append_after(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.clean
  end
end
</pre>

It will also modify *spec/rails_helper.rb*:

<pre>
config.use_transactional_fixtures = false
</pre>

h3. FactoryBot Configuration

The generator will set up FactoryBot shortcuts with a file *spec/support/factory_bot.rb*:

<pre>
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods
end
</pre>

h3. Install Devise Tests

If you want to install tests for Devise, you can run:

<pre>
$ rails generate testing:configure devise
</pre>

h3. Install OmniAuth Tests

If you want to install tests for OmniAuth, you can run:

<pre>
$ rails generate testing:configure omniauth
</pre>
